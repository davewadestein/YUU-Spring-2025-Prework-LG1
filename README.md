## Important
* Hi all, I know that some of you have faced some technical issues with BrightSpace and the Pluralsight platform and I'm sorry to hear about these issues!
  * I have no visibility into BrightSpace or the Pluralsight setup, so your first communication should be to your Year Up Project Manager. If they are unable to solve the issue, please reach out to
      * Sabrina Freytag  sabrina-freytag@pluralsight.com
      * Emilie Jones     emilie-jones@pluralsight.com

## You are agreeing to
1. if you use AI, USE AI. Keep going until you understand.
2. you don't just run a cell in a notebook–you have an idea of what it will do first, before pressing the run button

## How to get better at programming
* when you have working code, try to do it another way
* when you have working code, add more features (even if customer didn't ask for them)

# DWS
* "Efficiency doesn't matter until it matters, and it rarely matters"
* "Premature optimization is the root of all evil, while 97% of the time, programmers should focus on writing correct code rather than worrying about efficiency, there are still critical 3% cases where optimization is essential."

## Recording Policy
* OK, it turns out YearUp policy is NOT to distribute recordings–apparently they believe it encourages people to skip class or tune out during class. I agree that's possible, and I would prefer to share the recordings, but I have been told in no uncertain terms that I may not.
